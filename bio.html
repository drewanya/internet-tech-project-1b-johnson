        <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p><p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I grew up an only child, and traveled/relocated a bunch with my parents at a young age. This was partially influenced by Hurricane Katrina. By the time I was 6 I had lived in Texas, New York, and California and traveled to Europe twice. My mother is an actress, and my dad is a barber.<br>My mother is a beautiful singer and because of her, I have loved to sing for as long as I can remember. I wanted to be just like her when I grew up. I went to a creative arts high school for musical theatre, but decided not to continue that art for college. Instead, I decided to major in music therapy a Loyola University New Orleans. Eventually I decided that too was not the major for me and switched to music industry studies during my junior year.
